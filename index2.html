       <div class="tail"> <h1> 5 YOGA POSES</h1></div></body></br></br></br>
       <div class="head"> <h2> 1. Viparita Karani (Legs-up-the-Wall Pose)</h2></br></br>
        <img src="./images/Legs-Up-the-Wall_Andrew-Clark.webp"></br></br>
        <p>This is such a glorious pose and great for all levels of students! Leg-Up-the-Wall Pose is the best way to relax after a long day or practice on your feet. It drains the legs and is also a fantastic posture if you struggle with insomnia.</p></br></br></br>
        <h3>BEGINNER</h3> </br>
        <p>Place a folded blanket or bolster lengthwise along the wall. Sit on it sideways with one hip touching the wall. As you lie down, swivel around and sweep your legs up the wall, keeping your lower back elevated.</p></br></br>
        <h5>INTERMEDIATE</h5></br>
        <P>Lose the blanket or bolster, and just practice Legs-Up-the-Wall with your hips flush against the baseboard.</P></br></br>
        <h4>ADVANCED</h4></br>
        <p>Make a lasso out of a strap and tighten it around the balls of both of your feet. Bring your legs up the wall and wrap the strap around your shins twice. Take the tail end of the strap and thread it through the loop around your feet and two loops around your shins to tighten everything together. Let your legs fully relax.</p>
    </div></br></br></br>
    <div class="toss">
        <h2>2. Utthita Trikonasana (Extended Triangle Pose)</h2></br></br>
        <img src="./images/Extended-Triangle-Pose_Andrew-Clark.webp"></br></br>
        <p>Trikonasana. Such a classic standing pose! We live in a world where standing poses are often ignored, but this one is part of my regular practice come rain or shine. It is a glorious way to release your lower back, strengthen your core, and expand your body (and mind).</p></br></br></br>
        <h3>BEGINNER</h3> </br>
        <p>Students tend to collapse their lower body trying to get their hand or palm to the ground. Skip that step and place your palm either on a block outside of your shin or on your shin below your knee. This enables you to even out through both sides of your ribcage creating even length in the trunk of your body.</p></br></br>
        <h5>INTERMEDIATE</h5></br>
        <p>It’s so easy to get sassy in this pose! Most people stick out their butts (pitch in their lower backs) and puff their ribs. Focus on corseting your ribcage in (wrapping the bones towards your midline) and keeping your lower belly engaged and lifted to create space in your lower back.</p></br></br>
        <h4>ADVANCED</h4></br>
        <p>The final step is taking both of these tips and looking down. You want to line your torso up with your front leg (most students lean toward the inside). Can you keep both sides of your waist even, ribs in, belly engaged and lower back long as you lean back? Of course, you can! Practice, practice, practice.</p>
     </div></br></br></br>
     <div class="coin">
        <h2>3. Janu Sirsasana (Head-to-Knee Forward Bend)</h2></br></br>
        <img src="./images/Janu-Sirsasana_Andrew-Clark_1.webp"></br></br>
        <p>This one may seem random, but I have affection for it going all the way back to my Ashtanga days. This fabulous forward fold releases the calf and hamstring of the straight leg with the added benefit of opening the hip of the bent-knee leg. It also teaches the student to notice the effects of small nuances, such as squaring the chest with the straight-leg knee.</p></br></br></br>
        <h3>BEGINNER</h3> </br>
        <p>Sit up on a blanket or block. Place a strap over the ball of your straight-leg foot. Hold onto each side of the strap and focus on sitting tall without rounding your spine. Gently pull back on the strap so you feel it pull into your foot encouraging it to stay flexed.</p></br></br>
        <h5>INTERMEDIATE</h5></br>
        <p>To start, inhale and extend your spine long. As you exhale, pivot your belly button to face your straight-leg knee. Keep the twist and length as you grab either edge of your straight-leg foot.</p></br></br>   
        <h4>ADVANCED</h4></br>
        <p>Follow the steps above, but as your flexibility increases, clasp your outer wrist with your inner hand thumb and middle finger around the ball of your foot. Inhale as you clasp, and keeping your gaze forward, exhale and bend your elbows wide to draw you deeper into the fold.</p>
     </div></br></br></br>
     <div class="gram">
        <h2>4.Salamba Sirsasana II (Supported Headstand)</h2></br></br>
        <img src="./images/Headstand_Andrew-Clark.webp"></br></br>
        <p>Inversions are a magical group of postures that reverses our perspective and give us a strong dose of empowerment. Tripod Headstand is one of the easier inversions to balance because of the large foundation. It’s also fantastic to understand if you want to move into advanced transitions such as lowering into arm balances.</p></br></br></br>
        <h3>BEGINNER</h3> </br>
        <P>Place the crown of your head on the ground with your hands shoulder-width apart and elbows stacking over the heels of your hands. Curl your toes under and straighten your legs to enter a Dolphin Pose. Focus on keeping the elbows in (engage your adductors) and draw your shoulders up away from the ground to prevent collapsing into your neck. Try walking your feet in without loosing these actions.</P></br></br>
        <h5>INTERMEDIATE</h5></br>
        <p>Keep the same actions as above, but as you gain flexibility, walk your feet in enough so you can place one knee at a time onto the back of your arms (aim closer to the armpits if possible). Again, keep the elbows in and shoulders up to prevent collapsing your arms from the weight of your legs.</p></br></br>
        <h4>ADVANCED</h4></br>
        <p>From the knee position draw them up off of your arms and into your chest like a cannon ball. Continue to draw the legs up until they straighten out keeping the legs hugging into the midline the entire time. You can also enter this posture from Dolphin walking your feet in, keeping the legs straight, and entering from a press.</p>
     </div></br></br></br>

        <h2>5.Reclining Supported Twist</h2></br></br>
        <img src="./images/Reclining-Supported-Twist_Andrew-Clark-cropped.webp"></br></br>
        <p>A reclining twist is a great foundational pose to teach us how to twist safely. If you can learn the mechanics of a twist here, you’ll be safer when you practice this movement in more advanced postures.</p></br></br></br>
        <h3>BEGINNER</h3> </br>
        <p>Don’t force your knees to touch! You want this pose to meet you where you are rather than force yourself into a twist. You can take a folded blanket in between your knees to help support your top leg rather than overstretch your muscles.</p></br></br>
        <h5>INTERMEDIATE</h5></br>
        <p>Focus on your spinal alignment. It helps to scoot your hips an inch or two to the left before you lower your knees to the right to keep your back in a straight line. If it feels comfortable for you, turn to gaze opposite your knees. Tuck your chin ever so slightly to lengthen the back of your neck and keep that alignment from head to sit bones.</p></br></br>
        <h4>ADVANCED</h4></br>
        <p>Less is usually more. If you feel like you can safely handle an additional stretch, rest your opposite hand on your top thigh. Even this gentle weight can assist with intensifying the pose.</p>
